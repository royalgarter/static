However, when running for Electron, it has two\nissues:\n\n1. Electron has an internal filesystem format called [ASAR](https://github.com/electron/asar) which improves the performance of Electron apps. PM2 is unable to work with this format.\n2. Electron distributes it\'s own (embedded) NodeJS. However, PM2 ignores this and requires the end user to install another version of NodeJS.\n\nHence I created this new "Process Manager". It can be used without\nElectron of course but will also work perfectly with Electron without\nany of the existing PM2 issues.\n\n## Features\n\n1. Start multiple processes\n2. Start Python and NodeJS processes\n3. Understands NodeJS modules (you can just point to the module folder)\n4. WORKS WITH EMBEDDED Electron NodeJS\n5. Stop any started process whenever you want\n6. Direct the output to a log file\n7. Set the working directory and environment if needed\n8. Pass any required arguments to the scripts\n9. KEEP-ALIVE: Automatically restarts the process if crashes (completely configurable)\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### Getting started\n\n```javascript\nconst pm2 = require(\'@tpp/pm2\')\n\npm2.start({\n    script: \'path/to/script.py\',\n})\n```\n\n### Checking for errors with a callback\n\n`pm2` functions take an optional callback that is invoked when there are\nerrors.\n\n```javascript\npm2.start({\n    script: \'path/to/script.py\',\n}, (err, pid) => {\n    ...\n})\n```\n\nThe `start` callback can be invoked multiple times - for each error in\nthe process and when the process restarts. The callback also contains\nthe PID of the process when it starts. A callback without `pid` or `err`\nmeans it has terminated cleanly.\n\n\n### Passing arguments to scripts\n\n```javascript\npm2.start({\n    script: \'path/to/script.py\',\n    args: [\'say\',\'hello\'],\n})\n```\n\n### Setting Current Working Directory\n\n```javascript\npm2.start({\n    script: \'script.py\',\n    cwd: \'/path/to/folder\',\n})\n```\n\n### Using Node modules\n\nBecause `pm2` understands Node modules we can simply point to the module\nfolder and it will pick up the correct starting point.\n\n```javascript\npm2.start({\n    cwd: \'/path/to/npm/module/\',\n})\n```\n\n### Direct output to log file\n\n```javascript\npm2.start({\n    cwd: \'/path/to/npm/module/\',\n    log: \'mylog.log\',\n})\n```\n\n### Stopping a process\n\nIn order to stop a process it needs to be given a name:\n\n```javascript\npm2.start({\n    name: \'my-process\',\n    cwd: \'/path/to/npm/module/\',\n})\n\npm2.stop(\'my-process\')\n```\n\n`stop` also takes an optional callback that will be called when\nstopped/error.\n\n```javascript\npm2.stop(\'my-process\', (err) => {\n    ...\n})\n```\n\n### Stopping all processes\n\nYou can stop all running processes (named or un-named).\n\n```javascript\npm2.stopAll()\n```\n\n\n### Restart a process\n\nYou can also restart a named process.\n\n```javascript\npm2.restart(\'my-process\')\n```\n\nNote that `restart` does not take a callback. It uses the same callback\nyou provided to `start`.\n\n\n### Setting the environment\n\nYou can set the environment of the running process:\n\n```javascript\npm2.start({\n    script: \'path/to/script.py\',\n    env: ENVIRONMENT_OBJECT,\n})\n```\n\n\n## Stopping Hook\n\nIf you want to clean up your sub-processes or simply stop cleanly in a\nsub-process you can use the `onstopping` event handler:\n\n```javascript\nconst pm2 = require(\'@tpp/pm2\')\npm2.onstopping(() => {\n    ...\n})\n```\n\nOf course this only works if you\'re sub-process is a NodeJS module.\n\n\n## Crashing & Restarts\n\n![Crash](./crash.png)\n\nBy default `pm2` will restart any crashed processes. To prevent\n\'spinning\' it will restart each time with a delay:\n\n- First crash? Wait 100ms before restarting\n- Crashed again? Wait 500ms before restarting\n- Crashed again? Wait 1 second, then 10 seconds, then 30 seconds, then 1 minute, then 5 minutes before restarting\n- Still crashing? Re-try every 15 minutes\n\nIf it has been running successfully for 30 minutes assume started ok.\n\nThis is all configurable using the `restartAt` and `restartOk`\nparameters. The default parameters for the behaviour given above is:\n\n```javascript\npm2.start({\n    cwd: \'/path/to/npm/module/\',\n    restartAt: [100, 500, 1*1000, 10*1000, 30*1000, 60*1000, 5*60*1000],\n    restartOk: 30 * 60 * 1000,\n})\n```\n\nYou can design any restart strategy you want using the above parameters.\n\n### No Restart\nYou can turn the restarting behaviour off completely by setting\n`restartAt` to `[]` or `[0]`.\n\n\n## Terminal Output coloring\n\nIn some cases the output of programs designed for the terminal can\ncontain [ANSI Escape Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code).\nTo remove them specify `stripANSI:true` as an option.\n\n```javascript\npm2.start({\n    cwd: \'/path/to/npm/module/\',\n    log: \'mylog.log\',\n    stripANSI: true,\n})\n```\n\nThis is usually because you want a clean log file.\n\n\n\n## TODO\n[ ] Add Support for more process types (besides just python and node)\n\n-----------\n\nThe following NPM packages may be included in this product:\n\n - @emotion/babel-plugin@11.10.8\n - @emotion/cache@11.10.8\n - @emotion/css@11.10.8\n - @emotion/hash@0.9.0\n - @emotion/is-prop-valid@1.2.0\n - @emotion/memoize@0.8.0\n - @emotion/react@11.10.0\n - @emotion/react@11.10.5\n - @emotion/serialize@1.1.1\n - @emotion/sheet@1.2.1\n - @emotion/styled@11.10.0\n - @emotion/styled@11.10.5\n - @emotion/unitless@0.8.0\n - @emotion/use-insertion-effect-with-fallbacks@1.0.0\n - @emotion/utils@1.2.0\n - @emotion/weak-memoize@0.3.0\n\nThese packages each contain the following license and notice below:\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) Emotion team and other contributors\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Useful in situations when the output is connected with some calculated value - using `provide` you only need to calculate final value once and forward it to custom styling logic.\n\n```js\nprovide(getMessageFromSomewhere(), value => {\n  switch (value.level) {\n    case \'error\':\n      return container(\n        color(\'red\', modifier(\'bold\', value.level.toUpperCase())),\n        pad(2),\n        value.log\n      );\n    case \'info\':\n      return container(\n        color(\'blue\', value.level.toUpperCase()),\n        pad(2),\n        value.log\n      );\n    default:\n      return container(value.level.toUpperCase(), pad(2), value.log);\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\n\x3c!-- badges (common) --\x3e\n\n[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/l/ansi-fragments.svg?style=flat-square\n[license]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[prs-welcome-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square\n[prs-welcome]: http://makeapullrequest.com\n[coc-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20of-conduct-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square\n[coc]: https://github.com/zamotany/ansi-fragments/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n[chat-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-discord-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square&colorB=7289DA&logo=discord\n[chat]: https://discord.gg/zwR2Cdh\n\n[version]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ansi-fragments.svg?style=flat-square\n[package]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ansi-fragments\n\n-----------\n\nThe following NPM packages may be included in this product:\n\n - ansi-regex@4.1.1\n - ansi-regex@5.0.1\n - ansi-styles@3.2.1\n - ansi-styles@4.3.0\n - ansi-styles@5.2.0\n - callsites@3.1.0\n - camelcase-keys@6.2.2\n - camelcase@5.3.1\n - chalk@2.4.2\n - chalk@4.1.2\n - cli-cursor@3.1.0\n - escape-string-regexp@2.0.0\n - execa@1.0.0\n - find-up@3.0.0\n - find-up@4.1.0\n - get-stream@4.1.0\n - globals@11.12.0\n - has-flag@3.0.0\n - has-flag@4.0.0\n - is-fullwidth-code-point@3.0.0\n - is-interactive@1.0.0\n - leven@3.1.0\n - locate-path@3.0.0\n - locate-path@5.0.0\n - make-dir@2.1.0\n - mimic-fn@2.1.0\n - open@6.4.0\n - p-limit@2.3.0\n - p-locate@3.0.0\n - p-locate@4.1.0\n - p-try@2.2.0\n - parent-module@1.0.1\n - parse-json@4.0.0\n - path-exists@4.0.0\n - path-type@4.0.0\n - pify@4.0.1\n - pkg-dir@3.0.0\n - quick-lru@4.0.1\n - resolve-from@4.0.0\n - restore-cursor@3.1.0\n - slash@3.0.0\n - string-width@4.2.3\n - strip-ansi@5.2.0\n - strip-ansi@6.0.1\n - supports-color@5.5.0\n - supports-color@7.2.0\n - type-fest@0.7.1\n - wrap-ansi@6.2.0\n\nThese packages each contain the following license and notice below:\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) Sindre Sorhus <sindresorhus@gmail.com> (sindresorhus.com)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Because Babel 7\nwill be released as `@babel/core` instead of `babel-core`, maintainers have\nno way to do that transition without making a breaking change. e.g.\n\n```js\npeerDependencies: {\n  "babel-core": "6.x"\n}\n```\ncannot change to\n\n```js\npeerDependencies: {\n  "@babel/core": "6.x"\n}\n```\n\nwithout it being a breaking change.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo address this, we\'re releasing this bridge package, to allow users to do\n\n\n```js\npeerDependencies: {\n  "babel-core": "6.x | ^7.0.0-bridge"\n}\n```\n\nthen where users of this package would originally have done\n\n```sh\nnpm i some-package babel-core\n```\n\nto install Babel 6, they could now do\n\n\n```sh\nnpm i some-package babel-core@^7.0.0-bridge @babel/core\n```\n\nto install the bridge package, and install Babel 7\'s core.\n\n-----------\n\nThe following NPM package may be included in this product:\n\n - babel-plugin-macros@3.1.0\n\nThis package contains the following license and notice below:\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2020 Kent C.

Throws an error if the\ninput is invalid.\n\n```js\nvar obj = bser.loadFromBuffer(buf);\n```\n\n### bser.dumpToBuffer\n\nSynchronously encodes a value as BSER.\n\n```js\nvar encoded = bser.dumpToBuffer([\'hello\']);\nconsole.log(bser.loadFromBuffer(encoded)); // [\'hello\']\n```\n\n### BunserBuf\n\nThe asynchronous decoder API is implemented in the BunserBuf object.\nYou may incrementally append data to this object and it will emit the\ndecoded values via its `value` event.\n\n```js\nvar bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();\n\nbunser.on(\'value\', function(obj) {\n  console.log(obj);\n});\n```\n\nThen in your socket `data` event:\n\n```js\nbunser.append(buf);\n```\n\n## Example\n\nRead BSER from socket:\n\n```js\nvar bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();\n\nbunser.on(\'value\', function(obj) {\n  console.log(\'data from socket\', obj);\n});\n\nvar socket = net.connect(\'/socket\');\n\nsocket.on(\'data\', function(buf) {\n  bunser.append(buf);\n});\n```\n\nWrite BSER to socket:\n\n```js\nsocket.write(bser.dumpToBuffer(obj));\n```\n\n-----------\n\nThe following NPM package may be included in this product:\n\n - buffer-from@1.1.2\n\nThis package contains the following license and notice below:\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2016, 2018 Linus Unnebäck\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter\'s\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

This is so that you may use any ES6 standard Promise compliant library - or, of course, native ES6 Promises.\n\nIf you\'re running the code on a browser or node version that doesn\'t include native promises you will need to include a polyfill.  The following polyfills are tested as part of this module\'s test suite:-\n- [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake)\'s [ES6 Promise library](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) (which is actually adapted from [Stefan Penner](https://twitter.com/stefanpenner)\'s [RSVP.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js)). -  `require(\'es6-promise\').polyfill();`\n- [Getify](https://twitter.com/getify)\'s [Native Promise Only library](https://github.com/getify/native-promise-only) - `require(\'native-promise-only\');`\n- [ES6 Shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es6-shim) - `require(\'es6-shim\');`\n- [Calvin Metcalf](https://twitter.com/CWMma)\'s [Lie](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/lie) - `global.Promise = global.Promise || require(\'lie\');`\n\nNote: as of v1.2.0 you can use **denodeify** in the front end.  Pull it in via CommonJS, AMD or simply add to your webpage and it\'ll be available on `window.denodeify`. \n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install denodeify --save\n```\n\nOr:-\n\n```\nbower install denodeify --save\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nSimple example with [`readFile`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/read-file):-\n\n```js\nrequire(\'es6-promise\').polyfill();\n\nvar denodeify = require(\'denodeify\');\nvar readFile = denodeify(require(\'fs\').readFile);\n\nreadFile(\'my-file.txt\', { encoding: \'UTF-8\' })\n  .then(function(text) {\n    console.log("My file\'s contents is: " + text);\n  });\n```\n\n(Note: you will need to also install [es6-promise](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) with `npm install es6-promise` for this code sample to work within node versions that don\'t have `Promise` natively available)\n\nMore complex example with `exec`:-\n\n## Advanced usage\n\nYou can also pass in a function as a second argument of `denodeify` that allows you to manipulate the data returned by the wrapped function before it gets passed to the Promise\'s `reject` or `resolve` functions, for example:-\n\n```js\nrequire(\'es6-promise\').polyfill();\n\nvar denodeify = require(\'denodeify\');\nvar exec = denodeify(require(\'child_process\').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n\n  // Throw away stderr data\n  return [err, stdout];\n});\n\nexec(\'hostname\')\n  .then(function(host) {\n    console.log("My hostname is: " + host.replace(\'\\n\', \'\'));\n  });\n```\n\nOr,\n\n```js\nrequire(\'es6-promise\').polyfill();\n\nvar denodeify = require(\'denodeify\');\nvar exec = denodeify(require(\'child_process\').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n  return [err, [stdout, stderr]];\n});\n\nexec(\'my-command\')\n  .then(function(results) {\n    console.log("stdout is: " + results[0]);\n    console.log("stderr is: " + results[1]);\n  });\n```\n\nUseful for functions that return multiple arguments, for example [`child_process#exec`](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback).\n\n## Credits and collaboration ##\n\nThe lead developer of **denodeify** is [Matt Andrews](http://twitter.com/andrewsmatt) at FT Labs with much help and support from [Kornel Lesiński](https://twitter.com/pornelski).

Effective Date\n\n     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become\n     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes\n     such Contribution.\n\n2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n\n     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this\n     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution\n     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section\n     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\n\n     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n\n     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s\n        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n        Version); or\n\n     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its\n        Contributions.\n\n     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or\n     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the\n     notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n\n     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License\n     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted\n     under the terms of Section 3.3).\n\n2.5. Representation\n\n     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions\n     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the\n     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n\n2.6. Fair Use\n\n     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable\n     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\n\n2.7.

Distribution of Source Form\n\n     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the\n     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form\n     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how\n     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or\n     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\n     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\n        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\n        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\n        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\n        of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,\n        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for\n        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’\n        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\n     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the\n     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software\n     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered\n     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits\n     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of\n     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at\n     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of\n     either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\n     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including\n     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\n     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered\n     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent\n     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\n     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\n     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such\n     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You\n     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n     jurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\n   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial\n   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\n   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code\n   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all\n   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the\n   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n   understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\n     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\n     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\n     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\n     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,\n     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some\n     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.\n     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an\n     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by\n     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of\n     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become\n     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,\n     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or\n     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and\n     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License\n     shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\n     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\n     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\n     termination shall survive termination.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without\n   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,\n   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,\n   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire\n   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.\n   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any\n   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or\n   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this\n   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License\n   except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\n\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\n   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\n   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\n   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\n   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\n   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\n   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\n   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such\n   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\n   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\n   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\n\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of\n   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business\n   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without\n   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall\n   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter\n   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\n   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\n   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a\n   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe\n   this License against a Contributor.\n\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n      distinguishing version number.\n\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of\n      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or\n      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n      steward.\n\n10.3. Modified Versions\n\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified\n      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any\n      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such\n      modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\n      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\n      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n\n      This Source Code Form is subject to the\n      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.\n      2.0.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF\nTHE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT\'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n## 1. DEFINITIONS\n\n“Contribution” means:\n\n-   a\\) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content\n    Distributed under this Agreement, and\n-   b\\) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n    -   i\\) changes to the Program, and\n    -   ii\\) additions to the Program;\n\n    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from\n    and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n    “originates” from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\n    such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor\'s\n    behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the\n    Program that are not Modified Works.\n\n“Contributor” means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.\n\n“Licensed Patents” mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\nare necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\nor when combined with the Program.\n\n“Program” means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this\nAgreement.\n\n“Recipient” means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement\nor any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.\n\n“Derivative Works” shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other\nform, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the\neditorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\nrepresent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.\n\n“Modified Works” shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that\nresults from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the\ncontents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file\nin Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified\nWorks shall not include works that contain only declarations,\ninterfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely\nin each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program\nor Modified Works thereof.\n\n“Distribute” means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in\nany manner that enables the transfer of a copy.\n\n“Source Code” means the form of a Program preferred for making\nmodifications, including but not limited to software source code,\ndocumentation source, and configuration files.\n\n“Secondary License” means either the GNU General Public License, Version\n2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or\nadditional permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.\n\n## 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n-   a\\) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n    license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\n    publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n    Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\n-   b\\) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license\n    under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and\n    otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in\n    Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the\n    combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the\n    Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the\n    Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n    Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n    combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n    licensed hereunder.\n-   c\\) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each\n    Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by\n    any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights\n    or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses\n    granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to\n    secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For\n    example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient\n    to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient\'s responsibility to acquire\n    that license before distributing the Program.\n-   d\\) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n    license set forth in this Agreement.\n-   e\\) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor\n    makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in\n    this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient\'s receipt of the Program\n    under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of\n    Section 3).\n\n## 3. REQUIREMENTS\n\n3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n\n-   a\\) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance\n    with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a\n    statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this\n    Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable\n    manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange;\n    and\n-   b\\) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different\n    than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n    -   i\\) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n        warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\n        conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\n        conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n    -   ii\\) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n        liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental\n        and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n    -   iii\\) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients\' rights in the\n        Source Code under section 3.2; and\n    -   iv\\) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to\n        be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.\n\n3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n\n-   a\\) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i)\n    is combined with other material in a separate file or files made\n    available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor\n    attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this\n    Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of\n    such Secondary Licenses, and\n-   b\\) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n    the Program.\n\n3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\ntrademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\nof liability (‘notices’) contained within the Program from any copy of\nthe Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\ntheir own appropriate notices.\n\n## 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\nwith respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\nlicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the\nContributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering\nshould do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for\nother Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in\na commercial product offering, such Contributor (“Commercial\nContributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other\nContributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and\ncosts (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other\nlegal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\nContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\nCommercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the\nProgram in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this\nsection do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or\nalleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an\nIndemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\nContributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial\nContributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor\nin, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified\nContributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor\'s responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those\nperformance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\nContributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor\nmust pay those damages.\n\n## 5. NO WARRANTY {#warranty}\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS”\nBASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\nTITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\nappropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\nrisks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\nincluding but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\ncompliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or\nequipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n## 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY {#disclaimer}\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\nSHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\nEXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\nPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\nCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\nARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\nEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n## 7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action\nby the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\nextent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including\na cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\nitself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or\nhardware) infringes such Recipient\'s patent(s), then such Recipient\'s\nrights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\nlitigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient\'s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails\nto comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement\nand does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after\nbecoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient\'s rights under\nthis Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution\nof the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient\'s\nobligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient\nrelating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may\nonly be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves\nthe right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this\nAgreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has\nthe right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the\ninitial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\nresponsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\nentity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\nversion number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\nDistributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\nreceived. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is\npublished, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including\nits Contributions) under the new version.\n\nExcept as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\nreceives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\nContributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\nestoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\nunder this Agreement are reserved.

The code for the Flow parser [lives on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/flow/tree/master/src/parser).\n\n# What is the Flow Parser\n\nThe Flow Parser is a JavaScript parser written in OCaml. It produces an AST that conforms to the [ESTree spec](https://github.com/estree/estree) and that mostly matches what [esprima](http://esprima.org/) produces. The Flow Parser can be compiled to native code or can be compiled to JavaScript using [js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/). This npm package contains the Flow parser compiled to JavaScript.\n\n# Usage\n\nYou can use the Flow parser in your browser or in node. To use in node you can just do\n\n```JavaScript\nrequire(\'flow-parser\').parse(\'1+1\', {});\n```\n\nTo use in the browser, you can add\n\n```HTML\n<script src="flow_parser.js"><\/script>\n```\n\nwhich will make the `flow` object available to use like so:\n\n```JavaScript\nflow.parse(\'1+1\', {});\n```\n\n## Options\n\nThe second argument to `flow.parse` is the options object. Currently supported options:\n\n* `all_comments` (boolean, default `true`) - include a list of all comments from the whole program\n* `comments` (boolean, default `true`) - attach comments to AST nodes (`leadingComments` and `trailingComments`)\n* `enums` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of Flow enums\n* `esproposal_decorators` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of decorators\n* `esproposal_export_star_as` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of `export * as` syntax\n* `tokens` (boolean, default `false`) - include a list of all parsed tokens in a top-level `tokens` property\n* `types` (boolean, default `true`) - enable parsing of Flow types\n* `use_strict` (boolean, default `false`) - treat the file as strict, without needing a "use strict" directive\n\n-----------\n\nThe following NPM package may be included in this product:\n\n - follow-redirects@1.15.2\n\nThis package contains the following license and notice below:\n\nCopyright 2014–present Olivier Lalonde <olalonde@gmail.com>, James Talmage <james@talmage.io>, Ruben Verborgh\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js"><\/script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n<\/script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require(\'imurmurhash\');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3(\'string\');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash(\'more strings\');\nhashState.hash(\'even more strings\');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash(\'and\').hash(\'some\').hash(\'more\');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3(\'this is a test string\').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3(\'this is a\');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(\' test string\').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The main purpose of Mermaid is to help documentation catch up with development.\n\n> Doc-Rot is a Catch-22 that Mermaid helps to solve.\n\nDiagramming and documentation costs precious developer time and gets outdated quickly.\nBut not having diagrams or docs ruins productivity and hurts organizational learning.<br/>\nMermaid addresses this problem by enabling users to create easily modifiable diagrams. It can also be made part of production scripts (and other pieces of code).<br/>\n<br/>\n\nMermaid allows even non-programmers to easily create detailed diagrams through the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/).<br/>\n[Tutorials](./docs/config/Tutorials.md) has video tutorials.\nUse Mermaid with your favorite applications, check out the list of [Integrations and Usages of Mermaid](./docs/ecosystem/integrations.md).\n\nYou can also use Mermaid within [GitHub](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/) as well many of your other favorite applications—check out the list of [Integrations and Usages of Mermaid](./docs/ecosystem/integrations.md).\n\nFor a more detailed introduction to Mermaid and some of its more basic uses, look to the [Beginner\'s Guide](./docs/community/n00b-overview.md), [Usage](./docs/config/usage.md) and [Tutorials](./docs/config/Tutorials.md).\n\nIn our release process we rely heavily on visual regression tests using [applitools](https://applitools.com/). Applitools is a great service which has been easy to use and integrate with our tests.\n\n<a href="https://applitools.com/">\n<svg width="170" height="32" viewBox="0 0 170 32" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><mask id="a" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="27" y="0" width="143" height="32"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M27.732.227h141.391v31.19H27.733V.227z" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#a)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M153.851 22.562l1.971-3.298c1.291 1.219 3.837 2.402 5.988 2.402 1.971 0 2.903-.753 2.903-1.829 0-2.832-10.253-.502-10.253-7.313 0-2.904 2.51-5.45 7.099-5.45 2.904 0 5.234 1.004 6.955 2.367l-1.829 3.226c-1.039-1.075-3.011-2.008-5.126-2.008-1.65 0-2.725.717-2.725 1.685 0 2.546 10.289.395 10.289 7.386 0 3.19-2.724 5.52-7.528 5.52-3.012 0-5.916-1.003-7.744-2.688zm-5.7 2.259h4.553V.908h-4.553v23.913zm-6.273-8.676c0-2.689-1.578-5.02-4.446-5.02-2.832 0-4.409 2.331-4.409 5.02 0 2.724 1.577 5.055 4.409 5.055 2.868 0 4.446-2.33 4.446-5.055zm-13.588 0c0-4.912 3.442-9.07 9.142-9.07 5.736 0 9.178 4.158 9.178 9.07 0 4.911-3.442 9.106-9.178 9.106-5.7 0-9.142-4.195-9.142-9.106zm-5.628 0c0-2.689-1.577-5.02-4.445-5.02-2.832 0-4.41 2.331-4.41 5.02 0 2.724 1.578 5.055 4.41 5.055 2.868 0 4.445-2.33 4.445-5.055zm-13.587 0c0-4.912 3.441-9.07 9.142-9.07 5.736 0 9.178 4.158 9.178 9.07 0 4.911-3.442 9.106-9.178 9.106-5.701 0-9.142-4.195-9.142-9.106zm-8.425 4.338v-8.999h-2.868v-3.98h2.868V2.773h4.553v4.733h3.514v3.979h-3.514v7.78c0 1.111.574 1.936 1.578 1.936.681 0 1.326-.251 1.577-.538l.968 3.478c-.681.609-1.9 1.11-3.8 1.11-3.191 0-4.876-1.648-4.876-4.767zm-8.962 4.338h4.553V7.505h-4.553V24.82zm-.43-21.905a2.685 2.685 0 012.688-2.69c1.506 0 2.725 1.184 2.725 2.69a2.724 2.724 0 01-2.725 2.724c-1.47 0-2.688-1.219-2.688-2.724zM84.482 24.82h4.553V.908h-4.553v23.913zm-6.165-8.676c0-2.976-1.793-5.02-4.41-5.02-1.47 0-3.119.825-3.908 1.973v6.094c.753 1.111 2.438 2.008 3.908 2.008 2.617 0 4.41-2.044 4.41-5.055zm-8.318 6.453v8.82h-4.553V7.504H70v2.187c1.327-1.685 3.227-2.618 5.342-2.618 4.446 0 7.672 3.299 7.672 9.07 0 5.773-3.226 9.107-7.672 9.107-2.043 0-3.907-.86-5.342-2.653zm-10.718-6.453c0-2.976-1.793-5.02-4.41-5.02-1.47 0-3.119.825-3.908 1.973v6.094c.753 1.111 2.438 2.008 3.908 2.008 2.617 0 4.41-2.044 4.41-5.055zm-8.318 6.453v8.82H46.41V7.504h4.553v2.187c1.327-1.685 3.227-2.618 5.342-2.618 4.446 0 7.672 3.299 7.672 9.07 0 5.773-3.226 9.107-7.672 9.107-2.043 0-3.908-.86-5.342-2.653zm-11.758-1.936V18.51c-.753-1.004-2.187-1.542-3.657-1.542-1.793 0-3.263.968-3.263 2.617 0 1.65 1.47 2.582 3.263 2.582 1.47 0 2.904-.502 3.657-1.506zm0 4.159v-1.829c-1.183 1.434-3.227 2.259-5.485 2.259-2.761 0-5.988-1.864-5.988-5.736 0-4.087 3.227-5.593 5.988-5.593 2.33 0 4.337.753 5.485 2.115V13.85c0-1.756-1.506-2.904-3.8-2.904-1.829 0-3.55.717-4.984 2.044L28.63 9.8c2.115-1.901 4.84-2.726 7.564-2.726 3.98 0 7.6 1.578 7.6 6.561v11.186h-4.588z" fill="#00A298"></path></g><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M14.934 16.177c0 1.287-.136 2.541-.391 3.752-1.666-1.039-3.87-2.288-6.777-3.752 2.907-1.465 5.11-2.714 6.777-3.753.255 1.211.39 2.466.39 3.753m4.6-7.666V4.486a78.064 78.064 0 01-4.336 3.567c-1.551-2.367-3.533-4.038-6.14-5.207C11.1 4.658 12.504 6.7 13.564 9.262 5.35 15.155 0 16.177 0 16.177s5.35 1.021 13.564 6.915c-1.06 2.563-2.463 4.603-4.507 6.415 2.607-1.169 4.589-2.84 6.14-5.207a77.978 77.978 0 014.336 3.568v-4.025s-.492-.82-2.846-2.492c.6-1.611.93-3.354.93-5.174a14.8 14.8 0 00-.93-5.174c2.354-1.673 2.846-2.492 2.846-2.492" fill="#00A298"></path></svg>\n</a>\n\n\x3c!-- </Main description> --\x3e\n\n## Examples\n\n**The following are some examples of the diagrams, charts and graphs that can be made using Mermaid.

[![Commits](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/m/mermaid-js/mermaid)](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/graphs/contributors)\n\nMermaid is a growing community and is always accepting new contributors. There\'s a lot of different ways to help out and we\'re always looking for extra hands! Look at [this issue](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/866) if you want to know where to start helping out.\n\nDetailed information about how to contribute can be found in the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Security and safe diagrams\n\nFor public sites, it can be precarious to retrieve text from users on the internet, storing that content for presentation in a browser at a later stage. The reason is that the user content can contain embedded malicious scripts that will run when the data is presented. For Mermaid this is a risk, specially as mermaid diagrams contain many characters that are used in html which makes the standard sanitation unusable as it also breaks the diagrams. We still make an effort to sanitise the incoming code and keep refining the process but it is hard to guarantee that there are no loop holes.\n\nAs an extra level of security for sites with external users we are happy to introduce a new security level in which the diagram is rendered in a sandboxed iframe preventing javascript in the code from being executed. This is a great step forward for better security.\n\n_Unfortunately you can not have a cake and eat it at the same time which in this case means that some of the interactive functionality gets blocked along with the possible malicious code._\n\n## Reporting vulnerabilities\n\nTo report a vulnerability, please e-mail security@mermaid.live with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and if known, mitigations for the issue.\n\n## Appreciation\n\nA quick note from Knut Sveidqvist:\n\n> _Many thanks to the [d3](https://d3js.org/) and [dagre-d3](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre-d3) projects for providing the graphical layout and drawing libraries!_\n>\n> _Thanks also to the [js-sequence-diagram](https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams) project for usage of the grammar for the sequence diagrams.

HBC is integrated as a WASM binary generated by the emscripten toolchain and checked in as part of this package.\n\n## How to build HBC\n\nA pre-configured emscripten environment can be used through this [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/trzeci/emscripten/).

React Native itself uses this Babel preset by default when transforming your app\'s source code.\n\nIf you wish to use a custom Babel configuration by writing a `babel.config.js` file in your project\'s root directory, you must specify all the plugins necessary to transform your code. React Native does not apply its default Babel configuration in this case. So, to make your life easier, you can use this preset to get the default configuration and then specify more plugins that run before it.\n\n## Usage\n\nAs mentioned above, you only need to use this preset if you are writing a custom `babel.config.js` file.\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall `metro-react-native-babel-preset` in your app:\n\nwith `npm`:\n\n```sh\nnpm i metro-react-native-babel-preset --save-dev\n```\n\nor with `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add -D metro-react-native-babel-preset\n```\n\n### Configuring Babel\n\nThen, create a file called `babel.config.js` in your project\'s root directory. The existence of this `babel.config.js` file will tell React Native to use your custom Babel configuration instead of its own. Then load this preset:\n\n```\n{\n  "presets": ["module:metro-react-native-babel-preset"]\n}\n```\n\nYou can further customize your Babel configuration by specifying plugins and other options. See [Babel\'s `babel.config.js` documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files/) to learn more.\n\n## Help and Support\n\nIf you get stuck configuring Babel, please ask a question on Stack Overflow or find a consultant for help. If you discover a bug, please open up an issue.\n\n-----------\n\nThe following NPM package may be included in this product:\n\n - metro-resolver@0.73.9\n\nThis package contains the following license and notice below:\n\n# metro-resolver\n\n🚇 [Metro](https://facebook.github.io/metro/) resolution logic\n\n-----------\n\nThe following NPM package may be included in this product:\n\n - metro-source-map@0.73.9\n\nThis package contains the following license and notice below:\n\n# Metro\n\n🚇 The source map generator for [Metro](https://facebook.github.io/metro/).\n\n(TODO)\n\n-----------\n\nThe following NPM package may be included in this product:\n\n - metro@0.73.9\n\nThis package contains the following license and notice below:\n\n# Metro\n\n🚇 The JavaScript bundler for React Native.\n\n- **🚅 Fast**: We aim for sub-second reload cycles, fast startup and quick bundling speeds.\n- **⚖️ Scalable**: Works with thousands of modules in a single application.\n- **⚛️ Integrated**: Supports every React Native project out of the box.\n\nThis project was previously part of the [react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) repository.

default export.\n\n### `push(list, items)`\n\nAppend `items` (an array) at the end of `list` (another array).\nWhen `list` was empty, returns `items` instead.\n\nThis prevents a potentially expensive operation when `list` is empty,\nand adds items in batches to prevent V8 from hanging.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `list` (`unknown[]`) — List to operate on\n*   `items` (`unknown[]`) — Items to add to `list`\n\n###### Returns\n\n`list` or `items`\n\n### `splice(list, start, remove, items)`\n\nLike `Array#splice`, but smarter for giant arrays.\n\n`Array#splice` takes all items to be inserted as individual argument which\ncauses a stack overflow in V8 when trying to insert 100k items for instance.\n\nOtherwise, this does not return the removed items, and takes `items` as an\narray instead of rest parameters.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `list` (`unknown[]`) — List to operate on\n*   `start` (`number`) — Index to remove/insert at (can be negative)\n*   `remove` (`number`) — Number of items to remove\n*   `items` (`unknown[]`) — Items to inject into `list`\n\n###### Returns\n\n`void`\n\n## Security\n\nSee [`security.md`][securitymd] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for how to\nsubmit a

// [\'address\', \'article\', …]\nconsole.log(htmlRawNames) // [\'pre\', \'script\', …]\n```\n\n## API\n\nThis module exports the following identifiers: `htmlBlockNames`,\n`htmlRawNames`.\nThere is no default export.\n\n### `htmlBlockNames`\n\nList of lowercase HTML tag names (`Array<string>`) which when parsing HTML\n(flow), result in more relaxed rules (condition 6): because they are known\nblocks, the HTML-like syntax doesn’t have to be strictly parsed.\nFor tag names not in this list, a more strict algorithm (condition 7) is used\nto detect whether the HTML-like syntax is seen as HTML (flow) or not.\n\nThis is copied from: <https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#html-blocks>.\n\n### `htmlRawNames`\n\nList of lowercase HTML tag names (`Array<string>`) which when parsing HTML\n(flow), result in HTML that can include lines w/o exiting, until a closing tag\nalso in this list is found (condition 1).\n\nThis is copied from:\n<https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#html-blocks>.\n\nNote that `textarea` was added in `CommonMark@0.30`.\n\n## Security\n\nSee [`security.md`][securitymd] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for

utility to resolve subtokens.\n\n[Resolvers][resolver] are functions that take events and manipulate them.\nThis is needed for example because media (links, images) and attention (strong,\nitalic) aren’t parsed left-to-right.\nInstead, their openings and closings are parsed, and when done, their openings\nand closings are matched, and left overs are turned into plain text.\nBecause media and attention can’t overlap, we need to perform that operation\nwhen one closing matches an opening, too.\n\n## Contents\n\n*   [Install](#install)\n*   [Use](#use)\n*   [API](#api)\n    *

URL.\n\nThis encodes unsafe characters with percent-encoding and skips already\nencoded sequences (see `normalizeUri` internally).\nFurther unsafe characters are encoded as character references (see\n`micromark-util-encode`).\n\nA regex of allowed protocols can be given, in which case the URL is sanitized.\nFor example, `/^(https?|ircs?|mailto|xmpp)$/i` can be used for `a[href]`, or\n`/^https?$/i` for `img[src]` (this is what `github.com` allows).\nIf the URL includes an unknown protocol (one not matched by `protocol`, such\nas a dangerous example, `javascript:`), the value is ignored.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `url` (`string`) — URI to sanitize.\n*   `pattern` (`RegExp`, optional) — Allowed protocols.\n\n###### Returns\n\n`string` — Sanitized URI.\n\n### `normalizeUri(url[, pattern])`\n\nNormalize a URL (such as used in definitions).\n\nEncode unsafe characters with percent-encoding, skipping already encoded\nsequences.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `url` (`string`) — URI to normalize.\n\n###### Returns\n\n`string` — Normalized URI.\n\n## Security\n\nSee [`security.md`][securitymd] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for how to\nsubmit a security

*really complex things* with markdown\n\nSee [§ Comparison][comparison] for more info\n\n## Intro\n\nmicromark is a long awaited markdown parser.\nIt uses a [state machine][cmsm] to parse the entirety of markdown into concrete\ntokens.\nIt’s the smallest 100% [CommonMark][] compliant markdown parser in JavaScript.\nIt was made to replace the internals of [`remark-parse`][remark-parse], the most\n[popular][] markdown parser.\nIts API compiles to HTML, but its parts are made to be used separately, so as to\ngenerate syntax trees ([`mdast-util-from-markdown`][from-markdown]) or compile\nto other output formats.\n\n*   to learn markdown, see this [cheatsheet and tutorial][cheat]\n*   for more about us, see [`unifiedjs.com`][site]\n*   for updates, see [Twitter][]\n*   for questions, see

[`esm.sh`][esmsh]:\n\n```js\nimport {micromark} from \'https://esm.sh/micromark@3\'\n```\n\nIn browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:\n\n```html\n<script type="module">\n  import {micromark} from \'https://esm.sh/micromark@3?bundle\'\n<\/script>\n```\n\n## Use\n\nTypical use (buffering):\n\n```js\nimport {micromark} from \'micromark\'\n\nconsole.log(micromark(\'## Hello, *world*!\'))\n```\n\nYields:\n\n```html\n<h2>Hello, <em>world</em>!</h2>\n```\n\nYou can pass extensions (in this case [`micromark-extension-gfm`][gfm]):\n\n```js\nimport {micromark} from \'micromark\'\nimport {gfm, gfmHtml} from \'micromark-extension-gfm\'\n\nconst value = \'* [x] contact@example.com ~~strikethrough~~\'\n\nconst result = micromark(value, {\n  extensions: [gfm()],\n  htmlExtensions: [gfmHtml()]\n})\n\nconsole.log(result)\n```\n\nYields:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> <a href="mailto:contact@example.com">contact@example.com</a> <del>strikethrough</del></li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nStreaming interface:\n\n```js\nimport fs from \'fs\'\nimport {stream} from \'micromark/stream\'\n\nfs.createReadStream(\'example.md\')\n  .on(\'error\', handleError)\n  .pipe(stream())\n  .pipe(process.stdout)\n\nfunction handleError(error) {\n  // Handle your error here!\n  throw error\n}\n```\n\n## API\n\n`micromark` core has two entries in its export map: `micromark` and\n`micromark/stream`.\n\n`micromark` exports the following identifier: `micromark`.\n`micromark/stream` exports the following identifier: `stream`.\nThere are no default exports.\n\nThe export map supports the endorsed\n[`development` condition](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_resolving_user_conditions).\nRun `node --conditions development module.js` to get instrumented dev code.\nWithout this condition, production code is loaded.\nSee [§ Size & debug][size-debug] for more info.\n\n### `micromark(value[, encoding][, options])`\n\nCompile markdown to HTML.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n###### `value`\n\nMarkdown to parse (`string` or `Buffer`).\n\n###### `encoding`\n\n[Character encoding][encoding] to understand `value` as when it’s a\n[`Buffer`][buffer] (`string`, default: `\'utf8\'`).\n\n###### `options.defaultLineEnding`\n\nValue to use for line endings not in `value` (`string`, default: first line\nending or `\'\\n\'`).\n\nGenerally, micromark copies line endings (`\'\\r\'`, `\'\\n\'`, `\'\\r\\n\'`) in the\nmarkdown document over to the compiled HTML.\nIn some cases, such as `> a`, CommonMark requires that extra line endings are\nadded: `<blockquote>\\n<p>a</p>\\n</blockquote>`.\n\n###### `options.allowDangerousHtml`\n\nWhether to allow embedded HTML (`boolean`, default: `false`).\nSee [§ Security][security].\n\n###### `options.allowDangerousProtocol`\n\nWhether to allow potentially dangerous protocols in links and images (`boolean`,\ndefault: `false`).\nURLs relative to the current protocol are always allowed (such as, `image.jpg`).\nFor links, the allowed protocols are `http`, `https`, `irc`, `ircs`, `mailto`,\nand `xmpp`.\nFor images, the allowed protocols are `http` and `https`.\nSee [§ Security][security].\n\n###### `options.extensions`\n\nArray of syntax extensions ([`Array<SyntaxExtension>`][syntax-extension],\ndefault: `[]`).\nSee [§ Extensions][extensions].\n\n###### `options.htmlExtensions`\n\nArray of HTML extensions ([`Array<HtmlExtension>`][html-extension], default:\n`[]`).\nSee [§ Extensions][extensions].\n\n##### Returns\n\n`string` — Compiled HTML.\n\n### `stream(options?)`\n\nStreaming interface of micromark.\nCompiles markdown to HTML.\n`options` are the same as the buffering API above.\nNote that some of the work to parse markdown can be done streaming, but in the\nend buffering is required.\n\nmicromark does not handle errors for you, so you must handle errors on whatever\nstreams you pipe into it.\nAs markdown does not know errors, `micromark` itself does not emit errors.\n\n## Extensions\n\nmicromark supports extensions.\nThere are two types of extensions for micromark:\n[`SyntaxExtension`][syntax-extension],\nwhich change how markdown is parsed, and [`HtmlExtension`][html-extension],\nwhich change how it compiles.\nThey can be passed in [`options.extensions`][option-extensions] or\n[`options.htmlExtensions`][option-htmlextensions], respectively.\n\nAs a user of extensions, refer to each extension’s readme for more on how to use\nthem.\nAs a (potential) author of extensions, refer to\n[§ Extending markdown][extending-markdown] and\n[§ Creating a micromark extension][create-extension].\n\n### List of extensions\n\n*

[`wataru-chocola/micromark-extension-definition-list`](https://github.com/wataru-chocola/micromark-extension-definition-list)\n    — support definition lists\n\n### `SyntaxExtension`\n\nA syntax extension is an object whose fields are typically the names of hooks,\nreferring to where constructs “hook” into.\nThe fields at such objects are character codes, mapping to constructs as values.\n\nThe built in [constructs][] are an example.\nSee it and [existing extensions][extensions] for inspiration.\n\n### `HtmlExtension`\n\nAn HTML extension is an object whose fields are typically `enter` or `exit`\n(reflecting whether a token is entered or exited).\nThe values at such objects are names of tokens mapping to handlers.\n\nSee [existing extensions][extensions] for inspiration.\n\n### Extending markdown\n\nmicromark lets you change markdown syntax, yes, but there are alternatives.\nThe alternatives are often better.\n\nOver the years, many micromark and remark users have asked about their unique\ngoals for markdown.\nSome exemplary goals are:\n\n1.  I want to add `rel="nofollow"` to external links\n2.  I want to add links from headings to themselves\n3.  I want line breaks in paragraphs to become hard breaks\n4.  I want to support embedded music sheets\n5.  I want authors to add arbitrary attributes\n6.  I want authors to mark certain blocks with meaning, such as tip, warning,\n    etc\n7.  I want to combine markdown with JS(X)\n8.  I want to support our legacy flavor of markdown-like syntax\n\nThese can be solved in different ways and which solution is best is both\nsubjective and dependant on unique needs.\nOften, there is already a solution in the form of an existing remark or rehype\nplugin.\nRespectively, their solutions are:\n\n1.  [`remark-external-links`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-external-links)\n2.  [`rehype-autolink-headings`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings)\n3.  [`remark-breaks`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-breaks)\n4.  custom plugin similar to\n    [`rehype-katex`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/tree/main/packages/rehype-katex)\n    but integrating [`abcjs`](https://www.abcjs.net)\n5.  either [`remark-directive`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-directive)\n    and a custom plugin or with\n    [`rehype-attr`](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/rehype-attr)\n6.  [`remark-directive`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-directive)\n    combined with a custom plugin\n7.  combining the existing micromark MDX extensions however you please, such as\n    done by [`mdx-js/mdx`](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) or\n    [`xdm`](https://github.com/wooorm/xdm)\n8.  Writing a micromark extension\n\nLooking at these from a higher level, they can be categorized:\n\n*   **Changing the output by transforming syntax trees**\n    (1 and 2)\n\n    This category is nice as the format remains plain markdown that authors are\n    already familiar with and which will work with existing tools and platforms.\n\n    Implementations will deal with the syntax tree\n    ([`mdast`][mdast]) and the ecosystems\n    **[remark][]** and **[rehype][]**.\n    There are many existing\n    [utilities for working with that tree][utilities].\n    Many [remark plugins][] and [rehype plugins][] also exist.\n*   **Using and abusing markdown to add new meaning**\n    (3, 4, potentially 5)\n\n    This category is similar to *Changing the output by transforming syntax\n    trees*, but adds a new meaning to certain things which already have\n    semantics in markdown.\n\n    Some examples in pseudo code:\n\n    ````markdown\n    *   **A list item with the first paragraph bold**\n\n        And then more content, is turned into `<dl>` / `<dt>` / `<dd>` elements\n\n    Or, the title attributes on links or images is [overloaded](/url \'rel:nofollow\')\n    with a new meaning.\n\n    ```csv\n    fenced,code,can,include,data\n    which,is,turned,into,a,graph\n    ```\n\n    ```js data can="be" passed=true\n    // after the code language name\n    ```\n\n    HTML, especially comments, could be used as **markers**\x3c!--id="markers"--\x3e\n    ````\n*   **Arbitrary extension mechanism**\n    (potentially 5; 6)\n\n    This category is nice when content should contain embedded “components”.\n    Often this means it’s required for authors to have some programming\n    experience.\n    There are three good ways to solve arbitrary extensions.\n\n    **HTML**: Markdown already has an arbitrary extension syntax.\n    It works in most places and authors are already familiar with the syntax,\n    but it’s reasonably hard to implement securely.\n    Certain platforms will remove HTML completely, others sanitize it to varying\n    degrees.\n    HTML also supports custom elements.\n    These could be used and enhanced by client side JavaScript or enhanced when\n    transforming the syntax tree.\n\n    **Generic directives**: although\n    [a proposal][directive-proposal]\n    and not supported on most platforms, directives do work with many tools\n    already.\n    They’re not the easiest to author compared to, say, a heading, but sometimes\n    that’s okay.\n    They do have potential: they nicely solve the need for an infinite number of\n    potential extensions to markdown in a single markdown-esque way.\n\n    **MDX** also adds support for components by swapping HTML out for JS(X).\n    JSX is an extension to JavaScript, so MDX is something along the lines of\n    literate programming.\n    This does require knowledge of React (or Vue) and JavaScript, excluding some\n    authors.\n*   **Extending markdown syntax**\n    (7 and 8)\n\n    Extend the syntax of markdown means:\n\n    *   Authors won’t be familiar with the syntax\n    *   Content won’t work in other places (such as on GitHub)\n    *   Defeating the purpose of markdown: being simple to author and looking\n        like what it means\n\n    …and it’s hard to do as it requires some in-depth knowledge of JavaScript\n    and parsing.\n    But it’s possible and in certain cases very powerful.\n\n### Creating a micromark extension\n\nThis section shows how to create an extension for micromark that parses\n“variables” (a way to render some data) and one to turn a default construct off.\n\n> Stuck?\n> See [`support.md`][support].\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n*   You should possess an intermediate to high understanding of JavaScript:\n    it’s going to get a bit complex\n*   Read the readme of [unified][] (until you hit the API section) to better\n    understand where micromark fits\n*   Read the [§ Architecture][architecture] section to understand how micromark\n    works\n*   Read the [§ Extending markdown][extending-markdown] section to understand\n    whether it’s a good idea to extend the syntax of markdown\n\n#### Extension basics\n\nmicromark supports two types of extensions.\nSyntax extensions change how markdown is parsed.\nHTML extensions change how it compiles.\n\nHTML extensions are not always needed, as micromark is often used through\n[`mdast-util-from-markdown`][from-markdown] to parse to a markdown syntax tree\nSo instead of an HTML extension a `from-markdown` utility is needed.\nThen, a [`mdast-util-to-markdown`][to-markdown] utility, which is responsible\nfor serializing syntax trees to markdown, is also needed.\n\nWhen developing something for internal use only, you can pick and choose which\nparts you need.\nWhen open sourcing your extensions, it should probably contain four parts:\nsyntax extension, HTML extension, `from-markdown` utility, and a `to-markdown`\nutility.\n\nOn to our first case!\n\n#### Case: variables\n\nLet’s first outline what we want to make: render some data, similar to how\n[Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers) and the\nlike work, in our markdown.\nIt could look like this:\n\n```markdown\nHello, {planet}!\n```\n\nTurned into:\n\n```html\n<p>Hello, Venus!</p>\n```\n\nAn opening curly brace, followed by one or more characters, and then a closing\nbrace.\nWe’ll then look up `planet` in some object and replace the variable with its\ncorresponding value, to get something like `Venus` out.\n\nIt looks simple enough, but with markdown there are often a couple more things\nto think about.\nFor this case, I can see the following:\n\n*   Is there a “block” version too?\n*   Are spaces allowed?\n    Line endings?\n    Should initial and final white space be ignored?\n*   Balanced nested braces?\n    Superfluous ones such as `{{planet}}` or meaningful ones such as\n    `{a {pla} net}`?\n*   Character escapes (`{pla\\}net}`) and character references\n    (`{pla&#x7d;net}`)?\n\nTo keep things as simple as possible, let’s not support a block syntax, see\nspaces as special, support line endings, or support nested braces.\nBut to learn interesting things, we *will* support character escapes and\n\\-references.\n\nNote that this particular case is already solved quite nicely by\n[`micromark-extension-mdx-expression`][mdx-expression].\nIt’s a bit more powerful and does more things, but it can be used to solve this\ncase and otherwise serve as inspiration.\n\n##### Setup\n\nCreate a new folder, enter it, and set up a new package:\n\n```sh\nmkdir example\ncd example\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nIn this example we’ll use ESM, so add `type: \'module\'` to `package.json`:\n\n```diff\n@@ -2,6 +2,7 @@\n   "name": "example",\n   "version": "1.0.0",\n   "description": "",\n+  "type": "module",\n   "main": "index.js",\n   "scripts": {\n     "test": "echo \\"Error: no test specified\\" && exit 1"\n```\n\nAdd a markdown file, `example.md`, with the following text:\n\n```markdown\nHello, {planet}!\n\n{pla\\}net} and {pla&#x7d;net}.\n```\n\nTo check if our extension works, add an `example.js` module, with the following\ncode:\n\n```js\nimport {promises as fs} from \'node:fs\'\nimport {micromark} from \'micromark\'\nimport {variables} from \'./index.js\'\n\nmain()\n\nasync function main() {\n  const buf = await fs.readFile(\'example.md\')\n  const out = micromark(buf, {extensions: [variables]})\n  console.log(out)\n}\n```\n\nWhile working on the extension, run `node example` to see whether things work.\nFeel free to add more examples of the variables syntax in `example.md` if\nneeded.\n\nOur extension doesn’t work yet, for one because `micromark` is not installed:\n\n```sh\nnpm install micromark --save-dev\n```\n\n…and we need to write our extension.\nLet’s do that in `index.js`:\n\n```js\nexport const variables = {}\n```\n\nAlthough our extension doesn’t do anything, running `node example` now somewhat\nworks!\n\n##### Syntax extension\n\nMuch in micromark is based on character codes (see [§ Preprocess][preprocess]).\nFor this extension, the relevant codes are:\n\n*   `-5`\n    — M-0005 CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)\n*   `-4`\n    — M-0004 LINE FEED (LF)\n*   `-3`\n    — M-0003 CARRIAGE RETURN LINE FEED (CRLF)\n*   `null`\n    — EOF (end of the stream)\n*   `92`\n    — U+005C BACKSLASH (`\\`)\n*   `123`\n    — U+007B LEFT CURLY BRACE (`{`)\n*   `125`\n    — U+007D RIGHT CURLY BRACE (`}`)\n\nAlso relevant are the content types (see [§ Content types][content-types]).\nThis extension is a *text* construct, as it’s parsed alongsides links and such.\nThe content inside it (between the braces) is *string*, to support character\nescapes and -references.\n\nLet’s write our extension.\nAdd the following code to `index.js`:\n\n```js\nconst variableConstruct = {name: \'variable\', tokenize: variableTokenize}\n\nexport const variables = {text: {123: variableConstruct}}\n\nfunction variableTokenize(effects, ok, nok) {\n  return start\n\n  function start(code) {\n    console.log(\'start:\', effects, code);\n    return nok(code)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe above code exports an extension with the identifier `variables`.\nThe extension defines a *text* construct for the character code `123`.\nThe construct has a `name`, so that it can be turned off (optional, see next\ncase), and it has a `tokenize` function that sets up a state machine, which\nreceives `effects` and the `ok` and `nok` states.\n`ok` can be used when successful, `nok` when not, and so constructs are a bit\nsimilar to how promises can *resolve* or *reject*.\n`tokenize` returns the initial state, `start`, which itself receives the current\ncharacter code, prints some debugging information, and then returns a call\nto `nok`.\n\nEnsure that things work by running `node example` and see what it prints.\n\nNow we need to define our states and figure out how variables work.\nSome people prefer sketching a diagram of the flow.\nI often prefer writing it down in pseudo-code prose.\nI’ve also found that test driven development works well, where I write unit\ntests for how it should work, then write the state machine, and finally use a\ncode coverage tool to ensure I’ve thought of everything.\n\nIn prose, what we have to code looks like this:\n\n*   **start**:\n    Receive `123` as `code`, enter a token for the whole (let’s call it\n    `variable`), enter a token for the marker (`variableMarker`), consume\n    `code`, exit the marker token, enter a token for the contents\n    (`variableString`), switch to *begin*\n*   **begin**:\n    If `code` is `125`, reconsume in *nok*.\n    Else, reconsume in *inside*\n*   **inside**:\n    If `code` is `-5`, `-4`, `-3`, or `null`, reconsume in `nok`.\n    Else, if `code` is `125`, exit the string token, enter a `variableMarker`,\n    consume `code`, exit the marker token, exit the variable token, and switch\n    to *ok*.\n    Else, consume, and remain in *inside*.\n\nThat should be it!\nReplace `variableTokenize` with the following to include the needed states:\n\n```js\nfunction variableTokenize(effects, ok, nok) {\n  return start\n\n  function start(code) {\n    effects.enter(\'variable\')\n    effects.enter(\'variableMarker\')\n    effects.consume(code)\n    effects.exit(\'variableMarker\')\n    effects.enter(\'variableString\')\n    return begin\n  }\n\n  function begin(code) {\n    return code === 125 ? nok(code) : inside(code)\n  }\n\n  function inside(code) {\n    if (code === -5 || code === -4 || code === -3 || code === null) {\n      return nok(code)\n    }\n\n    if (code === 125) {\n      effects.exit(\'variableString\')\n      effects.enter(\'variableMarker\')\n      effects.consume(code)\n      effects.exit(\'variableMarker\')\n      effects.exit(\'variable\')\n      return ok\n    }\n\n    effects.consume(code)\n    return inside\n  }\n}\n```\n\nRun `node example` again and see what it prints!\nThe HTML compiler ignores things it doesn’t know, so variables are now removed.\n\nWe have our first syntax extension, and it sort of works, but we don’t handle\ncharacter escapes and -references yet.\nWe need to do two things to make that work:\na) skip over `\\\\` and `\\}` in our algorithm,\nb) tell micromark to parse them.\n\nChange the code in `index.js` to support escapes like so:\n\n```diff\n@@ -23,6 +23,11 @@ function variableTokenize(effects, ok, nok) {\n       return nok(code)\n     }\n\n+    if (code === 92) {\n+      effects.consume(code)\n+      return

Postprocess][postprocess]) by the tokens belonging to that content type.\n\n##### HTML extension\n\nUp next is an HTML extension to replace variables with data.\nChange `example.js` to use one like so:\n\n```diff\n@@ -1,11 +1,12 @@\n import {promises as fs} from \'node:fs\'\n import {micromark} from \'micromark\'\n-import {variables} from \'./index.js\'\n+import {variables, variablesHtml} from

object mapping “variables” to\nstrings and returns an HTML extension.\nThe extension hooks two functions to `variableString`, one when it starts,\nthe other when it ends.\nWe don’t need to do anything to handle the other tokens as they’re already\nignored by default.\n`enterVariableString` calls `buffer`, which is a function that “stashes” what\nwould otherwise be emitted.\n`exitVariableString` calls `resume`, which is the inverse of `buffer` and\nreturns the stashed value.\nIf the variable is defined, we ensure it’s made safe (with `this.encode`) and\nfinally output that (with `this.raw`).\n\n##### Further exercises\n\nIt works!\nWe’re done!\nOf course, it can be better, such as with the following potential features:\n\n*   Add support for empty variables\n*   Add support for spaces between markers and string\n*   Add support for line endings in variables\n*   Add support for nested braces\n*   Add support for blocks\n*   Add warnings on undefined variables\n*   Use `micromark-build`, and use `uvu/assert`, `debug`, and\n    `micromark-util-symbol` (see [§ Size & debug][size-debug])\n*   Add [`mdast-util-from-markdown`][from-markdown] and\n    [`mdast-util-to-markdown`][to-markdown] utilities to parse and serialize the\n    AST\n\n#### Case: turn off constructs\n\nSometimes it’s needed to turn a default construct off.\nThat’s possible through a syntax extension.\nNote that not everything can be turned off (such as paragraphs) and even if it’s\npossible to turn something off, it could break micromark (such as character\nescapes).\n\nTo disable constructs, refer to them by name in an array at the `disable.null`\nfield of an extension:\n\n```js\nimport {micromark} from \'micromark\'\n\nconst extension = {disable: {null: [\'codeIndented\']}}\n\nconsole.log(micromark(\'\\ta\', {extensions: [extension]}))\n```\n\nYields:\n\n```html\n<p>a</p>\n```\n\n## Architecture\n\nmicromark is maintained as a monorepo.\nMany of its internals, which are used in `micromark` (core) but also useful for\ndevelopers of extensions or integrations, are available as separate modules.\nEach module maintained here is available in [`packages/`][packages].\n\n### Overview\n\nThe naming scheme in [`packages/`][packages] is as follows:\n\n*   `micromark-build`\n    — Small CLI to build dev code into production code\n*   `micromark-core-commonmark`\n    — CommonMark constructs used in micromark\n*   `micromark-factory-*`\n    — Reusable subroutines used to parse parts of constructs\n*   `micromark-util-*`\n    — Reusable helpers often needed when parsing markdown\n*   `micromark`\n    — Core module\n\nmicromark has two interfaces: buffering (maintained in\n[`micromark/dev/index.js`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark/blob/main/packages/micromark/dev/index.js))\nand streaming (maintained in\n[`micromark/dev/stream.js`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark/blob/main/packages/micromark/dev/stream.js)).\nThe first takes all input at once whereas the last uses a Node.js stream to take\ninput separately.\nThey thinly wrap how data flows through micromark:\n\n```txt\n                                            micromark\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|            +------------+         +-------+         +-------------+         +---------+

  |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n```\n\n### Preprocess\n\nThe **preprocessor**\n([`micromark/dev/lib/preprocess.js`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark/blob/main/packages/micromark/dev/lib/preprocess.js))\ntakes markdown and turns it into chunks.\n\nA **chunk** is either a character code or a slice of a buffer in the form of a\nstring.\nChunks are used because strings are more efficient storage than character codes,\nbut limited in what they can represent.\nFor example, the input `ab\\ncd` is represented as `[\'ab\', -4, \'cd\']` in chunks.\n\nA character **code** is often the same as what `String#charCodeAt()` yields but\nmicromark adds meaning to certain other values.\n\nIn micromark, the actual character U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (HT) is replaced\nby one M-0002 HORIZONTAL TAB (HT) and between 0 and 3 M-0001 VIRTUAL SPACE (VS)\ncharacters, depending on the column at which the tab occurred.\nFor example, the input `\\ta` is represented as `[-2, -1, -1, -1, 97]` and `a\\tb`\nas `[97, -2, -1, -1, 98]` in character codes.\n\nThe characters U+000A LINE FEED (LF) and U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) are\nreplaced by virtual characters depending on whether they occur together: M-0003\nCARRIAGE RETURN LINE FEED (CRLF), M-0004 LINE FEED (LF), and M-0005 CARRIAGE\nRETURN (CR).\nFor example, the input `a\\r\\nb\\nc\\rd` is represented as\n`[97, -5, 98, -4, 99, -3, 100]` in character codes.\n\nThe `0` (U+0000 NUL) character code is replaced by U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER\n(`�`).\n\nThe `null` code represents the end of the input stream (called *eof* for end of\nfile).\n\n### Parse\n\nThe **parser**\n([`micromark/dev/lib/parse.js`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark/blob/main/packages/micromark/dev/lib/parse.js))\ntakes chunks and turns them into events.\n\nAn **event** is the start or end of a token amongst other events.\nTokens can “contain” other tokens, even though they are stored in a flat list,\nby entering before and exiting after them.\n\nA **token** is a span of one or more codes.\nTokens are most of what micromark produces: the built in HTML compiler or other\ntools can turn them into different things.\nTokens are essentially names attached to a slice, such as `lineEndingBlank` for\ncertain line endings, or `codeFenced` for a whole fenced code.\n\nSometimes, more info is attached to tokens, such as `_open` and `_close` by\n`attention` (strong, emphasis) to signal whether the sequence can open or close\nan attention run.\nThese fields have to do with how the parser works, which is complex and not\nalways pretty.\n\nCertain fields (`previous`, `next`, and `contentType`) are used in many cases:\nlinked tokens for subcontent.\nLinked tokens are used because outer constructs are parsed first.\nTake for example:\n\n```markdown\n- *a\n  b*.\n```\n\n1.  The list marker and the space after it is parsed first\n2.  The rest of the line is a `chunkFlow` token\n3.  The two spaces on the second line are a `linePrefix` of the list\n4.  The rest of the line is another `chunkFlow` token\n\nThe two `chunkFlow` tokens are linked together and the chunks they span are\npassed through the flow tokenizer.\nThere the chunks are seen as `chunkContent` and passed through the content\ntokenizer.\nThere the chunks are seen as a paragraph and seen as `chunkText` and passed\nthrough the text tokenizer.\nFinally, the attention (emphasis) and data (“raw” characters) is parsed there,\nand we’re done!\n\n#### Content types\n\nThe parser starts out with a document tokenizer.\n*Document* is the top-most content type, which includes containers such as block\nquotes and lists.\nContainers in markdown come from the margin and include more constructs\non the lines that define them.\n\n*Flow* represents the sections (block constructs such as ATX and setext\nheadings, HTML, indented and fenced code, thematic breaks), which like\n*document* are also parsed per line.\nAn example is HTML, which has a certain starting condition (such as `<script>`\non its own line), then continues for a while, until an end condition is found\n(such as `</style>`).\nIf that line with an end condition is never found, that flow goes until the end.\n\n*Content* is zero or more definitions, and then zero or one paragraph.\nIt’s a weird one, and needed to make certain edge cases around definitions spec\ncompliant.\nDefinitions are unlike other things in markdown, in that they behave like *text*\nin that they can contain arbitrary line endings, but *have* to end at a line\nending.\nIf they end in something else, the whole definition instead is seen as a\nparagraph.\n\nThe content in markdown first needs to be parsed up to this level to figure out\nwhich things are defined, for the whole document, before continuing on with\n*text*, as whether a link or image reference forms or not depends on whether\nit’s defined.\nThis unfortunately prevents a true streaming markdown parser.\n\n*Text* contains phrasing content (rich inline text: autolinks, character escapes\nand -references, code, hard breaks, HTML, images, links, emphasis, strong).\n\n*String* is a limited *text*-like content type which only allows character\nreferences and character escapes.\nIt exists in things such as identifiers (media references, definitions),\ntitles, or URLs and such.\n\n#### Constructs\n\nConstructs are the things that make up markdown.\nSome examples are lists, thematic breaks, or character references.\n\nNote that, as a general rule of thumb, markdown is *really weird*.\nIt’s essentially made up of edge cases rather than logical rules.\nWhen browsing the built in constructs, or venturing to build your own, you’ll\nfind confusing new things and run into complex custom hooks.\n\nOne more reasonable construct is the thematic break\n([see code](https://github.com/micromark/micromark/blob/main/packages/micromark-core-commonmark/dev/lib/thematic-break.js)).\nIt’s an object that defines a `name` and a `tokenize` function.\nMost of what constructs do is defined in their required `tokenize` function,\nwhich sets up a state machine to handle character codes streaming in.\n\n### Postprocess\n\nThe **postprocessor**\n([`micromark/dev/lib/postprocess.js`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark/blob/main/packages/micromark/dev/lib/postprocess.js))\nis a small step that takes events, ensures all their\nnested content is parsed, and returns the modified events.\n\n### Compile\n\nThe **compiler**\n([`micromark/dev/lib/compile.js`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark/blob/main/packages/micromark/dev/lib/compile.js))\ntakes events and turns them into HTML.\nWhile micromark was created mostly to advance markdown parsing irrespective of\ncompiling to HTML, the common case of doing so is built in.\nA built in HTML compiler is useful because it allows us to check for compliancy\nto CommonMark, the de facto norm of markdown, specified in roughly 650\ninput/output cases.\nThe parsing parts can still be used separately to build ASTs, CSTs, or many\nother output formats.\n\nThe compiler has an interface that accepts lists of events instead of the whole\nat once, but because markdown can’t truly stream, events are buffered before\ncompiling and outputting the final result.\n\n## Examples\n\n### GitHub flavored markdown (GFM)\n\nTo support GFM (autolink literals, strikethrough, tables, and tasklists) use\n[`micromark-extension-gfm`][gfm].\nSay we have a file like this:\n\n```markdown\n# GFM\n\n## Autolink literals\n\nwww.example.com, https://example.com, and contact@example.com.\n\n## Footnote\n\nA note[^1]\n\n[^1]: Big note.\n\n## Strikethrough\n\n~one~ or ~~two~~ tildes.\n\n## Table\n\n| a | b  |  c |  d  |\n| - | :- | -: | :-: |\n\n## Tag filter\n\n<plaintext>\n\n## Tasklist\n\n* [ ] to do\n* [x] done\n```\n\nThen do something like this:\n\n```js\nimport fs from \'node:fs\'\nimport {micromark} from \'micromark\'\nimport {gfm, gfmHtml} from \'micromark-extension-gfm\'\n\nconst doc =

determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following equation.\n\n$$\nL = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^2 S C_L\n$$\n```\n\nThen do something like this:\n\n```js\nimport fs from \'node:fs\'\nimport {micromark} from \'micromark\'\nimport {math, mathHtml} from \'micromark-extension-math\'\n\nconst doc = fs.readFileSync(\'example.md\')\n\nconsole.log(micromark(doc, {extensions: [math],

class="katex">…</span></span></div>\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Syntax tree\n\nA higher level project, [`mdast-util-from-markdown`][from-markdown], can give\nyou an AST.\n\n```js\nimport fromMarkdown from \'mdast-util-from-markdown\' // This wraps micromark.\n\nconst result = fromMarkdown(\'## Hello, *world*!\')\n\nconsole.log(result.children[0])\n```\n\nYields:\n\n```js\n{\n  type: \'heading\',\n  depth: 2,\n  children: [\n    {type: \'text\', value: \'Hello, \', position: [Object]},\n    {type: \'emphasis\', children: [Array], position: [Object]},\n    {type: \'text\', value: \'!\', position: [Object]}\n  ],\n  position: {\n    start: {line: 1, column: 1, offset: 0},\n    end: {line: 1, column: 19, offset: 18}\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnother level up is [**remark**][remark], which provides a nice interface and\nhundreds of plugins.\n\n## Markdown\n\n### CommonMark\n\nThe first definition of “Markdown” gave several examples of how it worked,\nshowing input Markdown and output HTML, and came with a reference implementation\n(`Markdown.pl`).\nWhen new implementations followed, they mostly followed the first definition,\nbut deviated from the first implementation, and added extensions, thus making\nthe format a family of formats.\n\nSome years later, an attempt was made to standardize the differences between\nimplementations, by specifying how several edge cases should be handled, through\nmore input and output examples.\nThis is known as [CommonMark][commonmark-spec], and many implementations now\nwork towards some degree of CommonMark compliancy.\nStill, CommonMark describes what the output in HTML should be given some\ninput, which leaves many edge cases up for debate, and does not answer what\nshould happen for other output formats.\n\nmicromark passes all tests from CommonMark and has many more tests to match the\nCommonMark reference parsers.\nFinally, it comes with [CMSM][], which describes how to parse markup, instead\nof documenting input and output examples.\n\n### Grammar\n\nThe syntax of markdown can be described in Backus–Naur form (BNF) as:\n\n```bnf\nmarkdown = .*\n```\n\nNo, that’s [not a typo](http://trevorjim.com/a-specification-for-markdown/):\nmarkdown has no syntax errors; anything thrown at it renders *something*.\n\n## Project\n\n### Comparison\n\nThere are many other markdown parsers out there and maybe they’re better suited\nto your use case!\nHere is a short comparison of a couple in JavaScript.\nNote that this list is made by the folks who make `micromark` and `remark`, so\nthere is some bias.\n\n**Note**: these are, in fact, not really comparable: micromark (and remark)\nfocus on completely different things than other markdown parsers do.\nSure, you can generate HTML from markdown with them, but micromark (and remark)\nare created for (abstract or concrete) syntax trees—to inspect, transform, and\ngenerate content, so that you can make things like [MDX][], [Prettier][], or\n[Gatsby][].\n\n###### micromark\n\nmicromark can be used in two different ways.\nIt can either be used, optionally with existing extensions, to get HTML easily.\nOr, it can give tremendous power, such as access to all tokens with positional\ninfo, at the cost of being hard to get into.\nIt’s super small, pretty fast, and has 100% CommonMark compliance.\nIt has syntax extensions, such as supporting 100% GFM compliance (with\n`micromark-extension-gfm`), but they’re rather complex to write.\nIt’s the newest parser on the block, which means it’s fresh and well suited for\ncontemporary markdown needs, but it’s also battle-tested, and already the 3rd\nmost popular markdown parser in JavaScript.\n\nIf you’re looking for fine grained control, use micromark.\nIf you just want HTML from markdown, use micromark.\n\n###### remark\n\n[remark][] is the most popular markdown parser.\nIt’s built on top of `micromark` and boasts syntax trees.\nFor an analogy, it’s like if Babel, ESLint, and more, were one project.\nIt supports the syntax extensions that micromark has (so it’s 100% CM compliant\nand can be 100% GFM compliant), but most of the work is done in plugins that\ntransform or inspect the tree, and there’s *tons* of them.\nTransforming the tree is relatively easy: it’s a JSON object that can be\nmanipulated directly.\nremark is stable, widely used, and extremely powerful for handling complex data.\n\nYou probably should use [remark][].\n\n###### marked\n\n[marked][] is the oldest markdown parser on the block.\nIt’s been around for ages, is battle tested, small, popular, and has a bunch of\nextensions, but doesn’t match CommonMark or GFM, and is unsafe by default.\n\nIf you have markdown you trust and want to turn it into HTML without a fuss, and\ndon’t care about perfect compatibility with CommonMark or GFM, but do appreciate\na small bundle size and stability, use [marked][].\n\n###### markdown-it\n\n[markdown-it][] is a good, stable, and essentially CommonMark compliant markdown\nparser, with (optional) support for some GFM features as well.\nIt’s used a lot as a direct dependency in packages, but is rather big.\nIt shines at syntax extensions, where you want to support not just markdown, but\n*your* (company’s) version of markdown.\n\nIf you need a couple of custom syntax extensions to your otherwise\nCommonMark-compliant markdown, and want to get HTML out, use [markdown-it][].\n\n###### Others\n\nThere are lots of other markdown parsers!\nSome say they’re small, or fast, or that they’re CommonMark compliant—but\nthat’s not always true.\nThis list is not supposed to be exhaustive (but it’s the most relevant ones).\nThis list of markdown parsers is a snapshot in time of why (not) to use\n(alternatives to) `micromark`: they’re all good choices, depending on what your\ngoals are.\n\n### Test\n\nmicromark is tested with the \\~650 CommonMark tests and more than 1.2k extra\ntests confirmed with CM reference parsers.\nThese tests reach all branches in the code, which means that this project has\n100% code coverage.\nFinally, we use fuzz testing to ensure micromark is stable, reliable, and\nsecure.\n\nTo build, format, and test the codebase, use `$ npm test` after clone and\ninstall.\nThe `$ npm run test-api` and `$ npm run test-coverage` scripts check either the\nunit tests, or both them and their coverage, respectively.\n\nThe `$ npm run test-fuzz` script does fuzz testing for 15 minutes.\nThe timeout is provided by GNU coreutils **timeout(1)**, which might not be\navailable on your system.\nEither install `timeout` or remove that part temporarily from the script and\nmanually exit the program after a while.\n\n### Size & debug\n\nmicromark is really small.\nA ton of time went into making sure it minifies well, by the way code is written\nbut also through custom build scripts to pre-evaluate certain expressions.\nFurthermore, care went into making it compress well with gzip and brotli.\n\nNormally, you’ll use the pre-evaluated version of micromark.\nWhile developing, debugging, or testing your code, you *should* switch to use\ncode instrumented with assertions and debug messages:\n\n```sh\nnode --conditions development module.js\n```\n\nTo see debug messages, use a `DEBUG` env variable set to `micromark`:\n\n```sh\nDEBUG="*" node --conditions development module.js\n```\n\n### Version\n\nmicromark adheres to [semver](https://semver.org) since 3.0.0.\n\n### Security\n\nThe typical security aspect discussed for markdown is [cross-site scripting\n(XSS)][xss] attacks.\nMarkdown itself is safe if it does not include embedded HTML or dangerous\nprotocols in links/images (such as `javascript:` or `data:`).\nmicromark makes any markdown safe by default, even if HTML is embedded or\ndangerous protocols are used, as it encodes or drops them.\nTurning on the `allowDangerousHtml` or `allowDangerousProtocol` options for\nuser-provided markdown opens you up to XSS attacks.\n\nAnother security aspect is DDoS attacks.\nFor example, an attacker could throw a 100mb file at micromark, in which case\nthe JavaScript engine will run out of memory and crash.\nIt is also possible to crash micromark with smaller payloads, notably when\nthousands of links, images, emphasis, or strong are opened but not closed.\nIt is wise to cap the accepted size of input (500kb can hold a big book) and to\nprocess content in a different thread or worker so that it can be stopped when\nneeded.\n\nUsing extensions might also be unsafe, refer to their documentation for more\ninformation.\n\nFor more information on markdown sanitation, see\n[`improper-markup-sanitization.md`][improper] by [**@chalker**][chalker].\n\nSee

August\nwith a couple of friends and potential sponsors.\nThe problem I (**[@wooorm][]**) had was that issues were piling up in remark and\nother repos, but my day job (teaching) was fun, fulfilling, and deserved time\ntoo.\nIt was getting hard to combine the two.\nThe thought was to feed two birds with one scone: fix the issues in remark with\na new markdown parser (codename marydown) while being financially supported by\nsponsors building fancy stuff on top, such as Gatsby, Contentful, and Vercel\n(ZEIT at the time).\n**[@johno][]** was making MDX on top of remark at the time (important historical\nnote: several other folks were working on JSX + markdown too).\nWe bundled our strengths: MDX was getting some traction and we thought together\nwe could perhaps make something sustainable.\n\nIn November 2018, we launched with the idea for micromark to solve all existing\nbugs, sustaining the existing hundreds of projects, and furthering the exciting\nhigh-level project MDX.\nWe pushed a single name: unified (which back then was a small but essential\npart of the chain).\nGatsby and Vercel were immediate sponsors.\nWe didn’t know whether it would work, and it worked.\nBut now you have a new problem: you are getting some financial support (much\nmore than other open source projects) but it’s not enough money for rent, and\ntoo much money to print stickers with.\nYou still have your job and issues are still piling up.\n\nAt the start of summer 2019, after a couple months of saving up donations, I\nquit my job and worked on unified through fall.\nThat got the number of open issues down significantly and set up a strong\ngovernance and maintenance system for the collective.\nBut when the time came to work on micromark, the money was gone again, so I\ncontracted through winter 2019, and in spring 2020 I could do about half open\nsource, half contracting.\nOne of the contracting gigs was to write a new MDX parser, for which I also\ndocumented how to do that with a state machine [in prose][mdx-cmsm].\nThat gave me the insight into how the same could be done for markdown: I drafted\n[CMSM][], which was some of the core ideas for micromark, but in prose.\n\nIn May 2020, Salesforce reached out: they saw the bugs in remark, how micromark\ncould help, and the initial work on CMSM.\nAnd they had thousands of Markdown files.\nIn a for open source uncharacteristic move, they decided to fund my work on\nmicromark.\nA large part of what maintaining open source means, is putting out fires,\ntriaging issues, and making sure users and sponsors are happy, so it was\namazing to get several months to just focus and make something new.\nI remember feeling that this project would probably be the hardest thing I’d\nwork on: yeah, parsers are pretty difficult, but markdown is on another level.\nMarkdown is such a giant stack of edge cases on edge cases on even more\nweirdness, what a mess.\nOn August 20, 2020, I released [2.0.0][200], the first working version of\nmicromark.\nAnd it’s hard to describe how that moment felt.\nIt was great.\n\n### License\n\n[MIT][license] © [Titus Wormer][author]\n\n\x3c!-- Definitions --\x3e\n\n[build-badge]:

Its objectives include effective levels of decoupling between devices and applications, designed to keep markets open and encourage the rapid growth of scalable Web and Enterprise middleware and applications.\n\n## Links\n\n- Project Website: [https://www.eclipse.org/paho](https://www.eclipse.org/paho)\n- Eclipse Project Information: [https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.paho](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.paho)\n- Paho Javascript Client Page: [https://eclipse.org/paho/clients/js/](https://eclipse.org/paho/clients/js)\n- GitHub: [https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.javascript](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.javascript)\n- Twitter: [@eclipsepaho](https://twitter.com/eclipsepaho)\n- Issues: [github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.javascript/issues](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.javascript/issues)\n- Mailing-list: [https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/paho-dev](https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/paho-dev\n\n\n## Using the Paho Javascript Client\n\n\n### Downloading\n\nA zip file containing the full and a minified version the Javascript client can be downloaded from the [Paho downloads page](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.paho/downloads)\n\nAlternatively the Javascript client can be downloaded directly from the projects git repository: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.javascript/master/src/paho-mqtt.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.javascript/master/src/paho-mqtt.js).\n\nPlease **do not** link directly to this url from your application.\n\n### Building from source\n\nThere are two active branches on the Paho Java git repository, ```master``` which is used to produce stable releases, and ```develop``` where active development is carried out. By default cloning the git repository will download the ```master``` branch, to build from develop make sure you switch to the remote branch: ```git checkout -b develop remotes/origin/develop```\n\nThe project contains a maven based build that produces a minified version of the client, runs unit tests and generates it\'s documentation.\n\nTo run the build:\n\n```\n$ mvn\n```\n\nThe output of the build is copied to the ```target``` directory.\n\n### Tests\n\nThe client uses the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) test framework. The tests for the client are in:\n\n```\nsrc/tests\n```\n\nTo run the tests with maven, use the following command:\n```\n$ mvn test\n```\nThe parameters passed in should be modified to match the broker instance being tested against.\n\n### Documentation\n\nReference documentation is online at: [http://www.eclipse.org/paho/files/jsdoc/index.html](http://www.eclipse.org/paho/files/jsdoc/index.html)\n\n### Compatibility\n\nThe client should work in any browser fully supporting WebSockets, [http://caniuse.com/websockets](http://caniuse.com/websockets) lists browser compatibility.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe included code below is a very basic sample that connects to a server using WebSockets and subscribes to the topic ```World```, once subscribed, it then publishes the message ```Hello``` to that topic. Any messages that come into the subscribed topic will be printed to the Javascript console.\n\nThis requires the use of a broker that supports WebSockets natively, or the use of a gateway that can forward between WebSockets and TCP.\n\n```JS\n// Create a client instance\nclient = new Paho.MQTT.Client(location.hostname, Number(location.port), "clientId");\n\n// set callback handlers\nclient.onConnectionLost = onConnectionLost;\nclient.onMessageArrived = onMessageArrived;\n\n// connect the client\nclient.connect({onSuccess:onConnect});\n\n\n// called when the client connects\nfunction onConnect() {\n  // Once a connection has been made, make a subscription and send a message.\n  console.log("onConnect");\n  client.subscribe("World");\n  message = new Paho.MQTT.Message("Hello");\n  message.destinationName = "World";\n  client.send(message);\n}\n\n// called when the client loses its connection\nfunction onConnectionLost(responseObject) {\n  if (responseObject.errorCode !== 0) {\n    console.log("onConnectionLost:"+responseObject.errorMessage);\n  }\n}\n\n// called when a message arrives\nfunction onMessageArrived(message) {\n  console.log("onMessageArrived:"+message.payloadString);\n}\n```\n\n-----------\n\nThe following NPM packages may be included in this product:\n\n - pako@1.0.11\n - pako@2.0.4\n\nThese packages each contain the following license and notice below:\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (C) 2014-2017 by Vitaly Puzrin and Andrei Tuputcyn\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n-----------\n\nThe following NPM package may be included in this product:\n\n - picocolors@1.0.0\n\nThis package contains the following license and notice below:\n\nISC License\n\nCopyright (c) 2021 Alexey Raspopov, Kostiantyn Denysov, Anton Verinov\n\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any\npurpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above\ncopyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES\nWITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.

If you\'re looking for the standalone React DevTools UI, **we suggest using [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools) instead of using this package directly**.\n\nThis package provides two entrypoints: labeled "backend" and "standalone" (frontend). Both APIs are described below.\n\n# Backend API\n\nBackend APIs are embedded in _development_ builds of renderers like [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) in order to connect to the React DevTools UI.\n\n### Example\n\nIf you are building a non-browser-based React renderer, you can use the backend API like so:\n\n```js\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== \'production\') {\n  const { connectToDevTools } = require("react-devtools-core");\n\n  // Must be called before packages like react or react-native are imported\n  connectToDevTools({\n    ...config\n  });\n}\n```\n\n> **NOTE** that this API (`connectToDevTools`) must be (1) run in the same context as React and (2) must be called before React packages are imported (e.g. `react`, `react-dom`, `react-native`).\n\n### `connectToDevTools` options\n| Prop | Default | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `host` | `"localhost"` | Socket connection to frontend should use this host. |\n| `isAppActive` |  | (Optional) function that returns true/false, telling DevTools when it\'s ready to connect to React. |\n| `port` | `8097` | Socket connection to frontend should use this port. |\n| `resolveRNStyle` |  | (Optional) function that accepts a key (number) and returns a style (object); used by React Native. |\n| `retryConnectionDelay` | `200` | Delay (ms) to wait between retrying a failed Websocket connection |\n| `useHttps` | `false` | Socket connection to frontend should use secure protocol (wss). |\n| `websocket` |  | Custom `WebSocket` connection to frontend; overrides `host` and `port` settings. |\n\n# Frontend API\n\nFrontend APIs can be used to render the DevTools UI into a DOM node. One example of this is [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools) which wraps DevTools in an Electron app.\n\n### Example\n```js\nimport DevtoolsUI from "react-devtools-core/standalone";\n\n// See the full list of API methods in documentation below.\nconst { setContentDOMNode, startServer } = DevtoolsUI;\n\n// Render DevTools UI into a DOM element.\nsetContentDOMNode(document.getElementById("container"));\n\n// Start socket server used to communicate between backend and frontend.\nstartServer(\n  // Port defaults to 8097\n  1234,\n\n  // Host defaults to "localhost"\n  "example.devserver.com",\n\n  // Optional config for secure socket (WSS).\n  {\n    key: fs.readFileSync(\'test/fixtures/keys/agent2-key.pem\'),\n    cert: fs.readFileSync(\'test/fixtures/keys/agent2-cert.pem\')\n  }\n);\n```\n\n### Exported methods\nThe `default` export is an object defining the methods described below.\n\nThese methods support chaining for convenience. For example:\n```js\nconst DevtoolsUI = require("react-devtools-core/standalone");\nDevtoolsUI.setContentDOMNode(element).startServer();\n```\n\n#### `connectToSocket(socket: WebSocket)`\n> This is an advanced config function that is typically not used.\n\nCustom `WebSocket` connection to use for communication between DevTools frontend and backend. Calling this method automatically initializes the DevTools UI (similar to calling `startServer()`).\n\n#### `openProfiler()`\nAutomatically select the "Profiler" tab in the DevTools UI.\n\n#### `setContentDOMNode(element: HTMLElement)`\nSet the DOM element DevTools UI should be rendered into on initialization.\n\n#### `setDisconnectedCallback(callback: Function)`\n_Optional_ callback to be notified when DevTools `WebSocket` closes (or errors).\n\n#### `setProjectRoots(roots: Array<string>)`\n_Optional_ set of root directories for source files. These roots can be used to open an inspected component\'s source code using an IDE.\n\n#### `setStatusListener(callback: Function)`\n_Optional_ callback to be notified of socket server events (e.g. initialized, errored, connected).\n\nThis callback receives two parameters:\n```js\nfunction onStatus(\n  message: string,\n  status: \'server-connected\' | \'devtools-connected\' | \'error\'\n): void {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n#### `startServer(port?: number, host?: string, httpsOptions?: Object, loggerOptions?: Object)`\nStart a socket server (used to communicate between backend and frontend) and renders the DevTools UI.\n\nThis method accepts the following parameters:\n| Name | Default | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `port` | `8097` | Socket connection to backend should use this port. |\n| `host` | `"localhost"` | Socket connection to backend should use this host. |\n| `httpsOptions` | | _Optional_ object defining `key` and `cert` strings. |\n| `loggerOptions` | | _Optional_ object defining a `surface` string (to be included with DevTools logging events). |\n\n# Development\n\nWatch for changes made to the backend entry point and rebuild:\n```sh\nyarn start:backend\n```\n\nWatch for changes made to the standalone UI entry point and rebuild:\n```sh\nyarn start:standalone\n```\n\nRun the standalone UI using `yarn start` in the [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools).\n\n-----------\n\nThe following NPM package may be included in this product:\n\n - react-dnd@14.0.5\n\nThis package contains the following license and notice below:\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Dan Abramov\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

In node 10 there is a core module named readline. Please use linebyline instead, it is the same module just renamed:\n[Npm linebyline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/linebyline)\n\n```sh\nnpm install linebyline\n```\n\n## Test\n```sh\nnpm install .\nnpm test\n\n```\n\n\n## What\'s this?\n\nSimple streaming readline module for NodeJS. Reads a file and buffers new lines emitting a _line_ event for each line.\n\n## Usage\n### Simple\n```js\n  var readline = require(\'linebyline\'),\n      rl = readline(\'./somefile.txt\');\n  rl.on(\'line\', function(line, lineCount, byteCount) {\n    // do something with the line of text\n  })\n  .on(\'error\', function(e) {\n    // something went wrong\n  });\n```\n\n### ASCII file decoding\nAs the underlying `fs.createReadStream` doesn\'t care about the specific ASCII encoding of the file, an alternative way to decode the file is by telling the `readline` library to retain buffer and then decoding it using a converter (e.g. [`iconv-lite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iconv-lite)).\n```js\n  var readline = require(\'linebyline\'),\n      rl = readline(\'./file-in-win1251.txt\', {\n    retainBuffer: true //tell readline to retain buffer \n  });\n  rl.on("line", function (data,linecount){\n    var line = iconv.decode(data, \'win1251\');\n    // do something with the line of converted text\n  });\n```\n##API\n## readLine(readingObject[, options])\n### Params:\n\n* `readingObject` - file path or stream object\n* `options` can include:\n  * `maxLineLength` - override the default 4K buffer size (lines longer than this will not be read)\n  * `retainBuffer` - avoid converting to String prior to emitting \'line\' event; will pass raw buffer with encoded data to the callback\n\n### Return:\n\n* **EventEmitter** \n\n\n## License\n\nBSD © [Craig Brookes](http://craigbrookes.com/)\n\n-----------\n\nThe following NPM package may be included in this product:\n\n - recast@0.20.5\n\nThis package contains the following license and notice below:\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Ben Newman <bn@cs.stanford.edu>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n"Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n-----------\n\nThe following NPM package may be included in this product:\n\n - redux-persist@5.10.0\n\nThis package contains the following license and notice below:\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 Zack Story\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

plugin to support math (`$C_L$`).\n\n## Contents\n\n*   [What is this?](#what-is-this)\n*   [When should I use this?](#when-should-i-use-this)\n*   [Install](#install)\n*   [Use](#use)\n*

[Compatibility](#compatibility)\n*   [Security](#security)\n*   [Related](#related)\n*   [Contribute](#contribute)\n*   [License](#license)\n\n## What is this?\n\nThis package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin to add support for math.\nYou can use this to add support for parsing and serializing this syntax\nextension.\n\n**unified** is a project that transforms content with abstract syntax trees\n(ASTs).\n**remark** adds support for markdown to unified.\n**mdast** is the markdown AST that remark uses.\n**micromark** is the markdown parser we use.\nThis is a remark plugin that adds support for the math syntax and AST to remark.\n\n## When should I use this?\n\nThis project is useful when you want to support math in markdown.\nExtending markdown with a syntax extension makes the markdown less portable.\nLaTeX equations are also quite hard.\nBut this mechanism works well when you want authors, that have some LaTeX\nexperience, to be able to embed rich diagrams of math in scientific text.\n\n## Install\n\nThis package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).\nIn Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:\n\n```sh\nnpm install remark-math\n```\n\nIn Deno with [Skypack][]:\n\n```js\nimport remarkMath from \'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-math@5?dts\'\n```\n\nIn browsers with [Skypack][]:\n\n```html\n<script type="module">\n  import remarkMath from \'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-math@5?min\'\n<\/script>\n```\n\n## Use\n\nSay we have the following file `example.md`:\n\n```markdown\nLift($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following\nequation.\n\n$$\nL = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^2 S C_L\n$$\n```\n\nAnd our module `example.js` looks as follows:\n\n```js\nimport {read} from \'to-vfile\'\nimport {unified} from \'unified\'\nimport remarkParse from \'remark-parse\'\nimport remarkMath from \'remark-math\'\nimport remarkRehype from \'remark-rehype\'\nimport rehypeKatex from \'rehype-katex\'\nimport rehypeStringify from \'rehype-stringify\'\n\nmain()\n\nasync function main() {\n  const file = await unified()\n    .use(remarkParse)\n    .use(remarkMath)\n    .use(remarkRehype)\n    .use(rehypeKatex)\n    .use(rehypeStringify)\n    .process(await read(\'example.md\'))\n\n  console.log(String(file))\n}\n```\n\nNow running `node example.js` yields:\n\n```html\n<p>Lift(<span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex">…</span></span>) can be determined by Lift Coefficient (<span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex">…</span></span>) like the following equation.</p>\n<div class="math math-display"><span class="katex-display">…</span></div>\n```\n\n## API\n\nThis package exports no identifiers.\nThe default export is `remarkMath`.\n\n### `unified().use(remarkMath[, options])`\n\nPlugin to support math.\n\n##### `options`\n\nConfiguration (optional).\n\n###### `options.singleDollarTextMath`\n\nWhether to support math (text) with a single dollar (`boolean`, default:\n`true`).\nSingle dollars work in Pandoc and many other places, but often interfere with\n“normal” dollars in text.\n\n## Syntax\n\nThis plugin applies a micromark extensions to parse the syntax.\nSee its readme for parse details:\n\n*   [`micromark-extension-math`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-math#syntax)\n\n> 👉 **Note**: `$math$` works similar to `` `code` ``.\n> That means escapes don’t work inside math but you can use more dollars around\n> the math instead: `$$\\raisebox{0.25em}{$\\frac a b$}$$`\n\n## HTML\n\nThis plugin integrates with [`remark-rehype`][remark-rehype].\nWhen mdast (markdown AST) is turned into hast (the HTML AST) the math nodes\nare turned into `<span class=math-inline>` and `<div class=math-block>`\nelements.\n\n## Syntax tree\n\nThis plugin applies one mdast utility to build and serialize the AST.\nSee its readme for the node types supported in the tree:\n\n*   [`mdast-util-math`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast-util-math#syntax-tree)\n\n## Types\n\nThis package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].\nIt exports an extra `Options` type which models the interface of the accepted\noptions.\n\nIf you’re working with the syntax tree, make sure to import this plugin\nsomewhere in your types, as that registers the new node types in the tree.\n\n```js\n/** @typedef {import(\'remark-math\')} */\n\nimport {visit} from \'unist-util-visit\'\n\n/** @type {import(\'unified\').Plugin<[], import(\'mdast\').Root>} */\nexport default function myRemarkPlugin() => {\n  return (tree) => {\n    visit(tree, (node) => {\n      // `node` can now be one of the nodes for math.\n    })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Compatibility\n\nProjects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained\nversions of Node.js.\nAs of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+.\nOur projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.\n\nThis plugin works with unified version 6+ and remark version 14+.\nThe previous major (version 4) worked with remark 13.\n\n## Security\n\nUse of `remark-math` itself does not open you up to [cross-site scripting\n(XSS)][xss] attacks.\nAlways be wary of user input and use [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize].\n\n## Related\n\n*   [`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm)\n    — support GFM (autolink literals, footnotes, strikethrough, tables,\n

The primary size is a CSS unit string (percentage or initial size). The measured sizes are pixels sizes.\n\n```tsx\nconst onSplitChanged = (primarySize: string) => {\n  console.log(`The split is: ${primarySize}`);\n};\n\nconst onMeasuredSizesChanged = (sizes: SplitMeasuredPixelSizes) => {\n  console.log(`The primary pane is: ${sizes.primary}px`);\n  console.log(`The splitter is: ${sizes.splitter}px`);\n  console.log(`The secondary pane is: ${sizes.secondary}px`);\n};\n\n<Split onSplitChanged={onSplitChanged} onMeasuredSizesChanged={onMeasuredSizesChanged}>\n  <div>Primary pane</div>\n  <div>Secondary pane<div>\n</Split>\n```\n# Integrating into a web application\n\nIf you are using a style framework like Fluent, Material UI, or Bootstrap then your root div will likely have CSS styles applied that help this splitter work correctly.\nIf you have no root stylesheet, you might have problems with vertical scrolling.\n\nHere are some recommended CSS properties for your top-level divs if you are building a single-page application.  In this case #app is the mounting point for React.Render.  You can see this approach used in the demo application.\n\n```css\nbody {\n  height: 100vh;\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  right: 0;\n  bottom: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  padding: 0;\n  margin: 0;\n}\n\nbody,\ndiv {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n\n#app {\n  position: relative;\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  outline: none;\n  overflow: hidden;\n}\n```\n\n-----------\n\nThe following NPM packages may be included in this product:\n\n - tslib@1.14.1\n - tslib@2.5.0\n\nThese packages each contain the following license and notice below:\n\nCopyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.\n\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any\npurpose with or without fee is hereby granted.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH\nREGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY\nAND FITNESS.
